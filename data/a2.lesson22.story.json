  "intro": "Photographic experience\nI went into our local chemist's shop and handed a roll of film to Mr. Dodd.\n\"I want to have this film developed and printed, please,\" I said. \"When will it be ready?\"\n\"On Tuesday,\" Mr. Dodd answered.\n\"I hope they're successful this time,\" I said and left the shop.\nI returned the following Tuesday. \"Is my film ready?\" I asked.\nMr. Dodd looked at me sadly. \"Here it is, Mr. Mead,\" he said.\nI opened the envelope eagerly and looked at the photographs.\n\"There are only eight photographs here!\" I exclaimed. \"I ought to have thirty-six!\"\n\"Did you take the photographs yourself?\" Mr. Dodd asked.\nI nodded.\n\"I'm afraid you spoiled the roll of film,\" he said. \"Your camera lets in light.\"\nI looked at the eight photographs. Two of them were almost black and three of them were almost white. I laughed when I saw the rest of them.\n\"My sister has no legs in this one. And look at this tree! It's growing out of my brother's head!\"\n\"I'm afraid they're not very successful,\" Mr. Dodd said.\n\"I'll never be a photographer!\" I said sadly.",
