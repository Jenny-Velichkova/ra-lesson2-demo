  "intro": "Dinner for Two\nMax Roberts is a bachelor. He lives in a small flat in London. Max not only enjoys eating food but he enjoys preparing it as well. His favourite hobby is cooking. He has had so much practice that he has become an expert cook.\nHis sister, Anne, called on him last Sunday evening. It was nearly dinner-time and Max was in the kitchen. He was wearing an apron and preparing a meal.\n\"You will stay for dinner, of course,\" Max said.\n\"I'm starving!\" Anne said. \"Is there enough food for both of us?\"\n\"I hope so,\" Max answered.\nAnne lifted the lid of the saucepan. \"Mmm,\" she said. \"It smells delicious. What is it?\"\n\"It's a Mexican dish,\" Max said. \"Very special.\"\n\"You'll be a good wife to some lucky woman,\" Anne remarked.\n\"I don't know about that,\" Max answered. \"But this dish ought to be good. I've been preparing it for five hours.\"\n\"There's enough food here for ten people!\" Anne said as she looked into the saucepan. \"Are you expecting company?\"\n\"No,\" Max replied, \"I was going to eat it all myself.\"\n(speak the words) - и трите упражнения",
