  "intro": "A Spanish Holiday\nWhen Alec returned to work last Monday, Bob asked him how he had spent his holiday.\n\"You went to Spain, didn't you?\" Bob asked.\n\"That's right,\" Alec answered. \"Three weeks in the sun, and now I've got a year's work ahead of me. Still, I must say I enjoyed myself. I went swimming every day, and I even saw a bullfight.\"\n\"Did you?\" Bob said. \"How was it?\"\n\"Very funny, really,\" Alec answered.\n\"I've never thought of a bullfight as being funny,\" Bob remarked.\n\"Well, this one was,\" Alec replied. \"The bullfighter was a showman. He arrived at the ring in a helicopter. The helicopter circled around the ring a few times, and then the bullfighter landed by parachute. He landed almost in the middle of the ring, just a few yards away from the bull. He was dressed in a splendid costume.\"\n\"That must have been very impressive,\" Bob said.\n\"I suppose it was,\" Alec answered. \"The trouble was that the poor man didn't know much about bullfighting. The bull went after him before he even managed to get his parachute off. He spent most of his time in the air!\"\n(speak the words) - и трите упражнения",
