  "intro": "Ready Money\nA young man went to a car showroom. He was wearing rubber boots and a dirty jacket. He needed a haircut badly and was unshaven. The young man examined an expensive car carefully and then turned to speak to the salesman.\n\"How much does this car cost?\" he asked.\n\"One thousand two hundred and eighteen pounds,\" the salesman said.\n\"I'll have sixteen of them,\" the young man said.\nThe salesman smiled. He found it hard to be polite. \"You are joking, of course,\" he said. \"I'm afraid we can't help you. This car is not for sale.\"\nThe salesman showed his customer the door and the young man left the shop without a word. He went to a showroom on the other side of the street and asked for sixteen cars. The second salesman was polite and helpful. The young man took a bundle of notes out of his pocket and paid for the cars in cash. He explained that the cars were for himself and his fifteen colleagues. He said that he and his colleagues worked on a Norwegian fishing boat. \"We have all earned a lot of money this season,\" the young man said, \"and we want to buy cars.\"\nNaturally, the second salesman was delighted.\n(speak the words) - и трите упражнения",
