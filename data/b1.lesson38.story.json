  "intro": "Money Problems\nMy brother, Henry, has an excellent job at a bank. I couldn’t believe him when he told me that he had decided to give it up. Though I tried to make him change his mind, I failed completely.\n\"You should reconsider your decision,\" I said. \"You have already spent five years in the bank and you could have a wonderful career. You might become a bank manager by the time you're thirty-five.\"\n\"I know,\" Henry answered. \"I've got no complaints with the bank. It's a pleasant job in pleasant surroundings and we keep civilized hours. The bank manager told me that my prospects were excellent.\"\n\"Then why do you want to leave?\" I exclaimed.\n\"It's the money,\" Henry said.\n\"But you're getting a good salary,\" I answered.\n\"I don't mean that,\" Henry said. \"What do I do at the bank? Well, at the moment, all I do is count money. I find it very depressing.\"\n\"What's depressing about counting money?\" I asked, unable to follow the logic of Henry's argument.\n\"You don't understand,\" Henry answered. \"I enjoy counting my own money, but I hate counting other people's!\"\n(speak the words) - и трите упражнения",
