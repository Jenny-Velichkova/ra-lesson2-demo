Look, it's on the fourth floor.\" Frank pointed at the numbers over the door of the lift.\n\"It will never come to the seventh floor,\" Judy said. \"Look, it's on the third floor now. It's going down again. We have been here for five minutes. We can't wait all day. I'm going to walk down the stairs.\"\n\"Well, I'm not going to walk down all those stairs,\" Frank said. \"I'll wait for you on the ground floor,\" Judy said.\n\"I'll be there before you,\" Frank replied.\nJudy walked down the stairs. She did not hurry. When she reached the ground floor, she looked for Frank. He wasn't there. She looked at the numbers over the door of the lift. The lift was on the fourth floor. The hall porter was looking at the numbers too and Judy spoke to him.\n\"What has happened to the lift?\" she asked.\n\"It has stopped between the third and fourth floors,\" the porter answered. \"That's the third time this morning!\"",
