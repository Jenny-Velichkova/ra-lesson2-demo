  "intro": "A Message From Nowhere\nThe Robinsons were expecting guests for dinner. The guests, who were all colleagues of Mr. Robinson, were due to arrive at six-thirty. It was a quarter past seven but they still hadn't appeared.\n\"I wonder what has happened to them,\" Mrs. Robinson asked her husband. \"Did you tell them how to get here?\"\n\"Of course I did,\" Mr. Robinson replied. \"I sent them detailed instructions and enclosed a sketch map.\"\n\"Perhaps they had an accident,\" Mrs. Robinson suggested. \"Were they coming by car?\"\n\"As far as I know,\" Mr. Robinson said.\nSuddenly the telephone rang and Mrs Robinson ran to answer it.\n\"Bill!\" she called. \"You're wanted on the phone!\"\nMr. Robinson picked up the receiver.\n\"Is that you, Bill?\" a voice said. \"I'm sorry we're late. We've lost our way. We took a wrong turn about ten miles back. I'm ringing from a public call box in a small village.\"\n\"What's the name of the village?\" Mr. Robinson asked.\n\"That's the trouble,\" the voice said. \"We don't know. This village doesn't seem to be marked on the map.\"\n(speak the words) - и трите упражнения",
