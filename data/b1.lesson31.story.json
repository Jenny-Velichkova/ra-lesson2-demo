  "intro": "First Flight\nFive tourists were walking slowly across the airfield where a very small aircraft was waiting for them. The plane was used on local flights and had only two engines.\nThe passengers got into the plane and sat down.\n\"Fasten your seatbelts, please,\" the air hostess said.\nAn old lady turned to the air hostess. \"Please help me with this belt,\" she asked. \"I have never been on an aeroplane before and I feel rather nervous.\"\n\"Don't worry,\" the air hostess said kindly. \"These planes are the safest in the world.\"\nThen the hostess went around with a tray of sweets. She offered a sweet to each of the passengers.\n\"Take one of these,\" she said to the old lady. \"It will help you to swallow.\"\nSuddenly, the plane began to shake and rattle. It moved quickly down the runway and slowly climbed into the air. When the plane was in the air, the hostess went to the old lady again. \"Didn't the sweet help you to swallow?\" she asked.\n\"No, I'm afraid it didn't,\" the old lady answered. \"But it took my mind off the plane. May I have another one, please?\"\n(speak the words) - и трите упражнения",
