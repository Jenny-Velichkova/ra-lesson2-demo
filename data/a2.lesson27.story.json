There were two live horses in the opera. The singers led them carefully across the stage a few times. But in the second act, one of the horses jumped off the stage and ran around the theatre. It refused to go back. Then the curtain came down and we all had to leave.\"\n\"Perhaps the horse couldn't sing,\" Fred suggested.",
