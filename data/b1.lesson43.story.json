  "intro": "Look Where You're Going!\nOne thing that has always impressed me about the Palace Hotel is the long line of glass doors at the entrance. The last time I stayed there, I got a surprise because some workmen were sticking ugly bands of gold tape on the glass doors.\n\"What are you doing that for?\" I asked one of the workmen. \"You will spoil the appearance of the building!\"\n\"We've been ordered to stick this tape on,\" a workman answered, \"because so many people try to walk through these doors. Last year, several residents were seriously injured and five of the doors were broken.\"\n\"I don't believe it,\" I said. \"Anyone can see a glass door. Why, that's the first thing you notice about this building.\"\n\"You'd be surprised at the number of people who don't even notice that these doors are made of glass,\" the workman answered.\n\"I've never heard of such nonsense!\" I exclaimed.\nSuddenly, there was a loud crash a few yards away from us. Sure enough, an unfortunate visitor had walked straight into one of the glass doors! He was rubbing his forehead and staring angrily at the glass door in front of him.\n\"You see what I mean!\" the workman said.\n(speak the words) - и трите упражнения",
