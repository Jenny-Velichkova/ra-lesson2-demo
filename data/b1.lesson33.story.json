  "intro": "The student\nMy cousin, John, is a university student. Last year, he went to Italy and stayed there for two months. I was surprised that John was able to have such a long holiday because he never had any money.\n\"How did you manage it, John?\" I asked. \"I thought you were going to stay for two weeks.\"\n\"It was easy,\" John answered. \"I got a job.\"\n\"A job!\" I exclaimed. \"What did you do?\"\n\"I gave English lessons to a grocer,\" John answered. \"His name is Luigi. We have become great friends.\"\n\"But you're not a teacher,\" I said.\n\"I told Luigi I couldn't teach,\" John explained. \"But he insisted on having conversation lessons. He wanted to practice his English. He has a lot of American customers, so it is important for him to speak English. I spent three hours a day talking to him. In return, he gave me a room, three meals a day, and a little pocket money.\"\n\"Did your pupil learn much English?\" I asked.\n\"I don't know,\" John said, \"but I learnt a lot of Italian!\"\n(speak the words) - и трите упражнения",
