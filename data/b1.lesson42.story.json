  "intro": "The Bag They Missed\nThe police received a report that six men had stopped a van. The van was carrying factory wages and the men had attacked the driver. They had tied him up and had stolen one of the bags. After searching for three hours, the police found the van near the river. The driver was sitting on a bag in the van and his hands were tied behind his back. The thieves had tied a handkerchief around his mouth so that he wouldn't shout. The police climbed into the back of the van and freed the driver. Then they asked him what had happened.\n\"I was stopped soon after I left the bank,\" the driver explained. \"Six men stopped my van and made me drive to the river. 'If you shout,' one of them said, 'we'll shoot you.' When I got to the river, they tied me up. Then they threw me into the back of the van. There were two bags in the back and the thieves took one of them.\"\n\"How much money did the bag contain?\" a police officer asked.\n\"It didn't contain any money at all,\" the driver laughed. \"It was full of letters. This one contains all the money. I've been sitting on it for three hours!\"\n(speak the words) - и трите упражнения",
