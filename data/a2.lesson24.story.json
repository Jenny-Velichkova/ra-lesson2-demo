  "intro": "The two tramps and the dog\nTwo tramps were walking along a quiet road. A sorry-looking dog was following them.\n“We've had a bad day, Joe,” the first tramp said. “We haven't any money and we can't get anything to eat.”\n“We'll find something,” the second tramp answered cheerfully. Suddenly, the tramps saw a car in the distance. It was coming towards them very quickly. Both the tramps moved to one side, but the dog stayed in the middle of the road.\nThe driver tried to stop the car, but it was too late. The car hit the dog and killed it. The driver got out of the car and went towards the first tramp.\n“Poor little dog,” the tramp said sadly.\n“Terribly sorry,” the driver said. “I tried to avoid your dog but I couldn't.” He took out his wallet and gave five pounds to the tramp. “Will that be all right?” the driver asked.\n“Yes, sir. Thank you, sir,” the tramp said.\nThe driver got into his car and drove away.\n“Poor little dog,” the first tramp said and put the money into his pocket.\n“Whose dog was it?” the second tramp asked.",
