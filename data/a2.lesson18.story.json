Listen to it!\"\n\"You must stop it, Jim,\" Mrs. Thompson said. \"That cat will wake up the baby.\"\n\"What can I do?\" Mr. Thompson asked. \"It's very cold. I'm not going into the garden.\"\n\"Throw a shoe at it,\" his wife suggested.\n\"I can't do that,\" Mr. Thompson answered.\n\"Why not?\" his wife asked. \"Can't you see it?\"\n\"I can see it very well,\" Mr. Thompson said. \"But I can't throw a shoe at it. It's sitting on my greenhouse!\"",
