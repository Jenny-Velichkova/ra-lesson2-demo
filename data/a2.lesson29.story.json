  "intro": "Easy to Drive\nA crowd of people gathered outside a car showroom. They were all looking at a new car that was being shown in the showroom window. The car was an automatic model that made it very easy to drive.\nThe salesman came out into the street and noticed the crowd. \"Good drivers will find this car a dream to drive,\" he said confidently. \"Women will find it especially easy because it's automatic and needs no gears. Watch, I'll give you a demonstration.\"\nThe salesman got into the car and started it up. He drove a few yards forward, then reversed. The car moved smoothly and effortlessly. However, as he was reversing, he accidentally pressed the accelerator too hard, and the car reversed straight into the showroom window, smashing the glass.\nEveryone gasped in surprise, and the salesman looked embarrassed but quickly stepped out of the car and said, \"It's definitely easy to drive, but a little too powerful!\"",
