He's singing.\"\n\"You're right!\" I said. \"He's in the bathroom!\"\nI knocked at the door of the bathroom. The singing stopped.\n\"Who is it?\" a voice said.\n\"This is our room,\" I answered. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\"Your room!\" the voice answered angrily. \"This is my room. Please go away. I'm taking a bath.\"\n\"I'll call the manager,\" my wife said.\nJust then, the door opened, and the manager came in.\n\"I'm very sorry,\" he said. \"I made a mistake. Your room is next door. Here are the keys to number twenty-two.\"",
