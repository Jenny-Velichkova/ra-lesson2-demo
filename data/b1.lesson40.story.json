  "intro": "An unwelcome visitor\nThe doorbell rang and Mrs. Carson opened the front door. Her heart sank when she saw Mrs Burbidge. Whenever Mrs. Burbidge called, she stayed for hours and hours.\n\"Good afternoon, Mrs. Carson,\" Mrs. Burbidge said. \"I was just passing and thought I'd drop in to say hello.\"\n\"How very thoughtful of you,\" Mrs. Carson replied. \"Do come in.\"\nJust as Mrs. Carson had feared, Mrs. Burbidge stayed for several hours. It was nearly six o'clock and Mr. Carson would be home from work soon. He couldn't stand Mrs Burbidge. Mrs. Carson kept wondering how she could persuade Mrs. Burbidge to leave without offending her.\n\"Has your husband got home from work yet?\" Mrs. Carson asked.\n\"Yes,\" Mrs. Burbidge answered. \"He always gets home about five o'clock.\"\n\"It's nearly six o'clock. Won't he be getting worried about you?\" Mrs. Carson said.\n\"I thought of that,\" Mrs. Burbidge said, \"but it's so pleasant here. We've had such a lovely afternoon. You know what I'll do? I'll ring up my husband and tell him to come around too. May I use your phone please?\"\n(speak the words) - и трите упражнения",
