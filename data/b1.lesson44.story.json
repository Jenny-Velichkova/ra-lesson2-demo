  "intro": "Baby-sitting\nBefore she left, Mrs Soames gave last-minute instructions to the babysitter, a young girl of seventeen. The girl had never done baby-sitting before and Mrs. Soames was a little anxious.\n\"Make yourself comfortable, Carol,\" Mrs Soames said. \"I've prepared a tray of food for you. It's on the table. You can, of course, listen to the radio or look at the television, but don't have it on too loud because you might wake our little boy. Sound carries terribly in this house. If the boy wakes up, go to his room and stay there for a few minutes. He'll go back to sleep immediately. Anyway, he's four years old, so you shouldn't have any trouble. My husband and I will be back at about eleven o'clock.\"\nMr. and Mrs. Soames returned rather later than they had expected. A light was still on in the living room and the television could just be heard. Mrs Soames went to the living room immediately and came out again a moment later holding the boy.\n\"What was he doing there?\" Mr. Soames exclaimed. \"He's wide awake.\"\n\"He was looking at the television,\" Mrs. Soames said.\n\"Where's Carol?\" Mr. Soames asked.\n\"She's still in the living room. She's fast asleep!\"\n(speak the words) - и трите упражнения",
